# third_party
This directory contains ("vendors") abbreviated copies of the following repositories:

The third_party/openapiv2 directory contains HTML, Javascript,
and CSS assets that dynamically generate Swagger documentation from a
Swagger-compliant API definition in [peer_service.swagger.json](./openapiv2/peer_service.swagger.json)
file. That file is auto-generated by running `make generate` in the root
of this repository. The static assets are copied from
[this dist folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist)
of the OpenAPI-UI project. After copying, [`index.html`](./openapiv2/index.html)
is edited to load the swagger file from the local server instead of the default petstore.
